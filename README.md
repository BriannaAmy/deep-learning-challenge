# Module 20 Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to build a neural network model that can predict, with an accuracy above 75%, whether or not applicants will be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup.

* Data Processing:
  * What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    * The IS_SUCCESSFUL variable is the target for the model.
  * What variable(s) are the features for your model?
    * The included variables used as the features are APPLICATION_TYPE, APPLICATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.
  * What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
    * The EIN and NAME variables were removed.

* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    * 
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

## Summary
